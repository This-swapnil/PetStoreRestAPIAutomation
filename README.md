# PetStoreRestAPI Automation

**Swagger Petstore is a publicly available RESTful API that provides a sample interface for testing, learning, and
demonstrating how to interact with REST APIs. It simulates a pet store system that manages pets, orders, and users,
making it an ideal sandbox for API testing tools, client SDKs, and automation frameworks.**

### Run Project Locally

Pre-requisite

1. Java JDK (21 is recommended)

Steps to run

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/This-swapnil/PetStoreRestAPIAutomation.git
```

2. Install all dependencies listed in the **pom.xml** file.

3. To run all test cases at once, execute the **testing.xml** file.

4. To run a single module, comment out the unwanted modules in the testing.xml file and then execute it.

#### Extent Reports and logs will be generated automatically when the testing.xml file is executed. Once all test cases have completed, the Extent Report will automatically open in the browser.
